Additionally, understanding the prevalence of news coverage devoted to mass shootings is important in determining how such an agenda is shaped and which events are given priority. The mass media play an important role in society as they define and shape issues and events rather than just reflecting what is occurring in society. The chapter discusses two key causal factors of mass shootings, such as gun control and mental health, and the subsequent shifts in public opinion. Proponents of gun control measures argue that tighter regulations will reduce the occurrence of mass shootings. Public opinion with regard to the gun control debate has been shown to be influenced by the occurrence of mass shootings. The chapter examines how public attitudes about mass shootings translate into other far-reaching impacts, such as perceived risks of victimization and fear of crime.},
